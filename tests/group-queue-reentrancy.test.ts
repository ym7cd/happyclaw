/**
 * Regression test for the critical self-reentrancy bug in drainWaiting.
 *
 * Bug: enqueueMessageCheck adds a jid to waitingGroups even while that jid's
 * OWN runner is active (state.active=true) — e.g. a group-mode scheduled task
 * injected while the group runner is busy. drainWaiting's guard was
 * `if (activeRunner && activeRunner !== jid) continue`, which did NOT skip a
 * self-active jid (activeRunner === jid). So when another group finished and
 * triggered drainWaiting, it started a SECOND concurrent runner on the same
 * GroupState → duplicate replies, orphaned container handle, broken counters.
 *
 * Fix: skip whenever ANY runner for the serialization key is active
 * (`if (activeRunner) continue`), plus a defensive `if (state.active) return`
 * guard in runForGroup/runTask. Pending work is drained by the active runner's
 * finally → drainGroup, so nothing is starved.
